How to use the .hex files.
Step 1. Download the Teensy Loader Application (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)
Step 2. Open the .hex file that you want to run. (File->Open HEX File)
Step 3. Plug in main board to computer and follow Teensy Loader prompts to load program
Step 4. It's logging to an SD card (if there's one in the Teensy). You can also monitor the Teensy with a serial monitor. 
The program logs data as fast as it can and for 50,000 samples along with microseconds and saves it to a file named H_#.csv where H is hydrophone and # is the number of files created since being turned on.
Be sure to record meta-data like which moon board (eg. R2A) is being used. This is needed in order to determine the conversion from unitless ADC integers to floats with proper units.
